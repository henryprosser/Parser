# Parser

Foundations of Computation Parser coursework. **Achieved a grade of 100%**.

First task was to convert a given grammar into Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)

Second task was to implement this converted grammar into code - `MyGrammar.java`

Third tasks was to create a Parser that decides whether a not an input string is generated by some arbitrary grammar in CNF. If this is true then a parse tree is returned - `Parser.java`
